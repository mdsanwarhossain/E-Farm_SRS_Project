# E-Farm_SRS_Project
The policy, scope, references, and summary of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) are all 
included in the SRS introduction. By presenting the problem statement in detail, the purpose of 
this document is to collect, evaluate, and provide a deeper understanding of the whole "E-Farm
" system. The main services of “E-Farm” are providing an agri marketplace & agri solution to 
the farmers.
The agriculture industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, and is the primary source of 
food and livelihood for millions of people around the world. However, the traditional agricultural 
supply chain has several challenges that impact both farmers and consumers. Farmers often 
struggle to get fair prices for their products due to the involvement of intermediaries such as 
brokers and syndicate traders, while consumers may not have access to high-quality, fresh food 
due to limitations in the traditional supply chain.
1.1 Problem Statement 
The traditional agricultural supply chain involves intermediaries such as brokers and syndicate 
traders, who often take a significant share of the profits and leave farmers with a lower price for 
their products. This can lead to unfair treatment of farmers and unsustainable practices in the 
agriculture industry. Additionally, consumers are increasingly concerned about the quality and 
source of their food, but may not have access to fresh, high-quality products due to limitations in 
the traditional supply chain.
E Farm is a B2B aggregator platform that aims to address these challenges by providing a 
marketplace for farmers to sell their products directly to consumers, cutting out intermediaries and 
ensuring fair prices for farmers. E Farm also offers equipment rental and maintenance services to 
make farming more cost-effective and efficient, as well as agro solution and consultancy services 
to provide guidance on everything from plant protection to post-harvest management.
However, there may be challenges in creating a successful supply chain ecosystem that connects 
farmers and consumers in a sustainable and efficient way. The purpose of this report is to assess 
the effectiveness of E Farm's services and identify any potential challenges or areas for 
improvement in the platform's business model.Prototype link::::https://www.canva.com/design/DAFXMKpWnLg/V0zkRByPu9KMAEuE4WL3KA/edit?utm_content=DAFXMKpWnLg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
